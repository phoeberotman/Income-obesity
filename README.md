# Income-obesity
The project explores the relationship between mean household income and obesity rates

Introduction
- Past studies have found significant relationships between food insecurity and obesity in the U.S. (Pan et al., 2015), and between household income and food insecurity. 
- Other studies have shown significant associations between income and obesity in specific population subgroups and U.S states (Odgen et al., 2005; Gong, et al., 2022). 
- The present study proposes that food insecurity partially mediates the relationship between income and obesity, and tests this hypothesis through OLS multivariate and bivariate regression tests.
- The study analyzes mean values of household income, obesity and food insecurity in all 50 states (except Florida, which had no data) and the District of Columbia
- The study also introduces comparison of state averages


Methodology
- Ran two-tailed significance tests for each regression in Stata
- State Health Data Set is compiled from the American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Center for Disease Control and Prevention). 


Findings 
- Insignificant (at p<.05), weak, negative association between income and obesity in bivariate and multivariate regression analyses 
- Significant (at p<.0001), positive, moderately strong correlation between food insecurity and obesity in bivariate and multivariate regression analyses
- Coefficient of determination showed that variation in income accounts for 4.08% of variation in obesity
- Coefficient of multiple determination (multivariate test) showed income and food insecurity account for 28.4% of variance in obesity     


Conclusion
- Mediation mechanism was not supported
- The association between income and food insecurity was not supported when analyzed through state averages, which raises interesting questions about potential mediations by rurality, access to grocery stores, income disparity and transportation. 
- The partial mediation mechanism in the study should be retested in a distinct or within a subpopulation for which a significant relationship has been established between income and food insecurity
